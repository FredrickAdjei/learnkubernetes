In Kubernetes, a DaemonSet is a type of workload that ensures that a copy of a Pod is running on every node in a cluster. DaemonSets are used for deploying system-level agents, logging collectors, monitoring agents,
or any other task that needs to run on all nodes of the cluster.
Here are the key characteristics and use cases for DaemonSets:

One Pod Per Node: A DaemonSet creates one instance of a Pod on each node in the cluster. This ensures that a specific workload or agent is running on every node.
Automatic Node Addition: When new nodes are added to the cluster (e.g., during auto-scaling), DaemonSets automatically detect them and schedule Pods on the new nodes, maintaining the desired state.
Node Removal: If a node is removed from the cluster (e.g., due to scaling down or node failure), DaemonSets automatically terminate the associated Pods on the removed node.
System-Level Tasks: DaemonSets are commonly used for tasks that are required to run on every node, such as logging, monitoring, security agents, and network plugins.
Node Constraints: DaemonSets can use node selectors or node affinity rules to control which nodes they are scheduled on based on node labels, allowing you to target specific types of nodes if needed.
Update Strategy: Updating DaemonSets can be managed using different update strategies, such as rolling updates, to ensure minimal disruption during updates.
Here's an example of a simple DaemonSet definition in Kubernetes:

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: DaemonSet
metadata:
  name: my-daemonset
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: my-container
        image: my-image:latest
In this example:

The DaemonSet named "my-daemonset" ensures that one instance of the Pod is running on each node.
The Pod is labeled with "app: my-app," and the DaemonSet targets nodes with the label "app: my-app."
The template section defines the Pod's specifications, including the container image to run.
To create a DaemonSet from this definition, you can use the kubectl apply -f command with the YAML file.

DaemonSets are a fundamental building block for deploying system-level services in Kubernetes, providing a way to ensure that specific workloads run on all nodes reliably and efficiently.
