Labels and selectors are fundamental concepts in Kubernetes used for organizing, selecting, and querying resources within a cluster. They are key components of how Kubernetes manages and groups resources.
Labels:
Labels are key-value pairs associated with Kubernetes resources such as Pods, Services, Deployments, and more.
Labels are used to attach metadata to resources, making it easier to identify, categorize, and organize them.
Labels are not unique, and multiple resources can have the same label key with different values.
Labels are typically defined in the metadata section of a resource's YAML specification.
metadata:
  labels:
    app: myapp
    environment: production


Selectors:
Selectors are used to filter and select resources based on their labels.
They enable you to specify criteria for identifying a group of resources that meet certain conditions.
Resources can be selected for various purposes, such as associating Pods with a Service or identifying Pods for scaling.
Selectors are commonly used in combination with Services, Deployments, ReplicaSets, and other controllers.
Example of selecting Pods with a label selector in a Service:
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: myapp
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 8080
In this example, the Service selects Pods with the label app: myapp and forwards traffic to them.

example
Identify the POD which is part of the prod environment, the finance BU and of frontend tier?
env=prod,bu=finance,tier=frontend 
kubectl get pods --selector env=prod,bu=finance,tier=frontend 

Use Kubectl get pods --selector - to get pods according to their labels
