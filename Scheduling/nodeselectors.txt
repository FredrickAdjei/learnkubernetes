NodeSelector is a Kubernetes feature used to schedule Pods to specific nodes in the cluster based on node labels. 
It allows you to specify node affinity rules for Pods, ensuring that they are placed on nodes that meet certain criteria or have specific characteristics.
Here's how NodeSelector works:
Node Labels: First, you need to label your nodes with key-value pairs that represent their attributes or characteristics. 
For example, you can label nodes to indicate their hardware capabilities, location, or other distinguishing features. Here's an example of labeling a node
-  kubectl label nodes <node-name> <label-key>=<label-value>
Pod NodeSelector: Next, you define a NodeSelector in the Pod's YAML configuration. The NodeSelector specifies the label key-value pairs that a node must have to be considered a suitable candidate for scheduling the Pod. Here's an example:
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
spec:
  nodeSelector:
    <label-key>: <label-value>
  containers:
  - name: my-container
    image: nginx
